## Planto
This Android Java app is designed to help plant enthusiasts and farmers in detecting and classifying plant diseases, as well as identifying plants in real-time using object detection algorithm through the camera of their smartphones. This app provides an AR feature that is not available in any other app.

## Features
# Plant Disease Classification: This app uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow to classify plant diseases. Users can capture a photo of the plant and upload it to the app. The app will then analyze the image and provide the user with the disease classification.

# Object Detection: This app uses OpenCV with an object detection algorithm to detect and identify plants in real-time using the camera of the phone. The algorithm works with the camera still opened in real-time, which provides an AR experience that is not available in any other app.

# Community and User Accounts: Users can create accounts and authenticate with the app. This feature enables them to connect with other users and share information about plant diseases and how to prevent them.

# Weed Detection: This app uses 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN) to classify videos that have weeds in them. The user can upload a video of the weeds, and the app will analyze it and provide the user with the classification.

## Technologies Used
# TensorFlow: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework that is used to build and train machine learning models, such as the CNN model used for plant disease classification.

# OpenCV: OpenCV is an open-source computer vision library that is used for object detection and identification.

# Android Java: This app is built using Java programming language for the Android platform.

# OpenAI API: OpenAI API is used to access new AI models developed by OpenAI, which can be used to improve the app's performance.

# Firebase Realtime Database: Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database used to store and retrieve data in real-time.
