# Planto - AI-AR App
>    ### Planto is an android Java app that helps plant owners and farmers identify and classify plant diseases and detect plants in real-time using state-of-the-art AI algorithms. This app is built on the popular CNN TensorFlow, OpenCV, and PySlowFast libraries that provide a robust and reliable platform for image and video analysis.

# Key Features 
1.   ### Plant Disease Classification: 
>    The app uses a powerful CNN TensorFlow algorithm to identify and classify plant diseases by analyzing the leaves' images. To classify the plant diseases, you just have to take a picture of the leaf, and the app will provide the name and the symptoms of the disease. This feature is incredibly helpful for plant owners and farmers to take care of their plants and improve their productivity.

2.   ### AR Plant Detection: 
>    Planto also has an AR feature that uses the object detection algorithm with the help of OpenCV library to detect and identify plants in real-time. You don't have to take photos here; just open your phone camera, and the app will leave it open for the object detection algorithm to do its work in real-time. This feature is unique, and no other app provides this kind of service to its users.

3.   ### Community: 
>    The app also has a community where users can create accounts quickly and authenticate using their other accounts like Gmail or Facebook. This feature helps users stay connected, share their experiences and knowledge, and provide feedback to the developers to improve the app's functionality and usability.

4.   ### 3D CNN Video Classification Algorithm:
>    Planto uses advanced technology like PySlowFast by Facebook for 3DCNN video classification. This algorithm helps to classify videos that have weeds in them. This feature is essential for farmers as it helps them identify and remove weeds from their fields, leading to better crop yields.
