# Planto
>    ### This Android Java app is designed to help plant enthusiasts and farmers in detecting and classifying plant diseases, as well as identifying plants in real-time using object detection algorithm through the camera of their smartphones. This app provides an AR feature that is not available in any other app.

# Features 
1.   ### Plant Disease Classification: 
>    This app uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow to classify plant diseases. Users can capture a photo of the plant and upload it to the app. The app will then analyze the image and provide the user with the disease classification.

2.   ### Object Detection: 
>    This app uses OpenCV with an object detection algorithm to detect and identify plants in real-time using the camera of the phone. The algorithm works with the camera still opened in real-time, which provides an AR experience that is not available in any other app.

3.   ### Community and User Accounts: 
>    Users can create accounts and authenticate with the app. This feature enables them to connect with other users and share information about plant diseases and how to prevent them.

4.   ### Weed Detection:
>    This app uses 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN) to classify videos that have weeds in them. The user can upload a video of the weeds, and the app will analyze it and provide the user with the classification.

# Technologies Used
> 1.   ### TensorFlow: 
>    TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework that is used to build and train machine learning models, such as the CNN model used for plant disease classification.

> 2.   ### OpenCV: 
>    OpenCV is an open-source computer vision library that is used for object detection and identification.

> 3.   ### Android Java: 
>    This app is built using Java programming language for the Android platform.

> 4.   ### OpenAI API: 
>    OpenAI API is used to access new AI models developed by OpenAI, which can be used to improve the app's performance.

> 5.   ### Firebase Realtime Database: 
>    Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database used to store and retrieve data in real-time.
